# app-combineROI

Combine multiple ROI datatypes into one ROI file. 

NOTE: The rois supplied MUST BE IN ALIGNMENT with one another -- they must
be in the same space. If the rois to be combined are not in alignment with
one another, then the output of this app will be UNUSABLE
(even though the app will not fail to complete).

If, for example, the the first input ROI has 2 rois inside of it and the second input ROI has 3 rois 
inside of it, then the output will be an ROI dataset with 5 rois inside of it.

### On Brainlife.io

You can submit this App online at [https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.313](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.313) via the "Execute" tab.

### Running Locally (on your machine)

1. git clone this repo.
2. Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

```json
{
"rois1": "testdata/roi1/",
"rois2": "testdata/roi2/"
}
```

3. Launch the App by executing `main`

```bash
./main
```

### Sample Datasets

If you don't have your own input file, you can download sample datasets from Brainlife.io, or you can use [Brainlife CLI](https://github.com/brain-life/cli).


## Output

All output files will be generated under the current working directory (pwd). The main output of this App is the ROI folder that contains .nii.gz files for each ROI in the input folders. This file contains following object.

### Dependencies

None.
